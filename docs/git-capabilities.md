## Immediate Applications

### Commit Assistance
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
from typing import List

class ChangeType(Enum):
    ADDED = "added"
    MODIFIED = "modified"
    DELETED = "deleted"

class ImpactLevel(Enum):
    HIGH = "high"
    MEDIUM = "medium"
    LOW = "low"

@dataclass
class FileChanges:
    path: str
    change_type: ChangeType
    impact: ImpactLevel

class CommitAssistant:
    def analyze_changes(self) -> List[FileChanges]:
        pass
    
    def generate_message(self) -> str:
        pass
    
    def suggest_scope(self) -> str:
        pass
    
    def validate_conventions(self) -> bool:
        pass
```

### Branch Management
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Dict

@dataclass
class ConflictReport:
    files: List[str]
    conflicts: Dict[str, List[str]]

@dataclass
class Strategy:
    name: str
    description: str
    steps: List[str]

class BranchManager:
    def suggest_branch_name(self, feature: str) -> str:
        pass
    
    def analyze_merge_conflicts(self) -> ConflictReport:
        pass
    
    def recommend_merge_strategy(self) -> Strategy:
        pass
```

### Code Review Tools
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List

@dataclass
class Change:
    file: str
    line: int
    content: str
    severity: str

@dataclass
class CheckItem:
    description: str
    category: str
    priority: int

class ReviewAssistant:
    def identify_critical_changes(self) -> List[Change]:
        pass
    
    def suggest_reviewers(self) -> List[str]:
        pass
    
    def generate_review_checklist(self) -> List[CheckItem]:
        pass
```

## Technical Examples

### Commit Message Generation
```python
from typing import List
import asyncio

async def generate_commit_message(changes: List[FileChanges]) -> str:
    scope = analyze_change_scope(changes)
    change_type = determine_change_type(changes)
    description = summarize_changes(changes)
    
    return f"{change_type}({scope}): {description}"
```

### Conflict Resolution
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List

@dataclass
class Resolution:
    file: str
    resolved_content: str
    applied_strategy: str

async def resolve_merge_conflict(file: str) -> Resolution:
    conflicts = await detect_conflicts(file)
    history = await analyze_file_history(file)
    
    return generate_resolution_suggestion(conflicts, history)
```

### Review Analysis
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List

@dataclass
class Diff:
    file: str
    changes: List[str]

@dataclass
class ReviewSuggestion:
    critical_changes: List[Change]
    patterns: List[str]
    impact_level: str

async def analyze_for_review(diff: Diff) -> ReviewSuggestion:
    critical_changes = identify_critical_changes(diff)
    patterns = detect_patterns(diff)
    impact = assess_impact(diff)
    
    return ReviewSuggestion(critical_changes, patterns, impact)
```
